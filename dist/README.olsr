# WARNING: olsr support is just an other nasty hack to OBMAP
#

You need to have olsrd version >= 0.5 . Prevois versions
do not include the txtinfo plugin.

OBMAPxP tries to connect to 127.0.0.1 tcp port 2006 to talk
to the olsrd_txtinfo plugin. 
olsrd_txtinfo.so.0.1 is the only version I have tested.

Put something like that into your olsrd.conf:

LoadPlugin "olsrd_txtinfo.so.0.1"
{
	        PlParam "accept" "127.0.0.1"
}
